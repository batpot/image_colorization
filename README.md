# Image Colorization

This repository contains a project focused on building an image colorization model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to take grayscale images as input and generate realistic color versions of those images using deep learning techniques.

> This project was developed as part of coursework for the Computational Intelligence course at the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.
